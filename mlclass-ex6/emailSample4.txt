Good Morning Ilya,

When dealing with excess noise, as outlined in the rental agreement, step one would be to contact you neighbor to see if you can resolve any issues.  Have you been able to speak with your neighbor so that they can understand the problem? 
 
Step two would be to contact us while noise is occurring so that we can assess the situation and respond while there is an ongoing problem.  You can contact us at anytime, day or night, by first calling the office, and then contacting the emergency/after hours number on the answering machine.

Step three would be to contact the police if steps one and two are not successful.  They will respond and issue noise citations when applicable.

Please feel free to give me a call or stop by the office if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Sarah
